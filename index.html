            <h4>What tighter control?</h4>
            <p>After the Seven Years' War, Britain ended its policy of "salutary neglect" and began asserting more direct control over the colonies. This included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Proclamation of 1763: Restricting colonial expansion west of the Appalachian Mountains.</li>
                <li>New Taxes: The Sugar Act (1764) and Stamp Act (1765) were designed to raise revenue directly from the colonies, which was a new form of economic control.</li>
                <li>Enforcement of Trade Laws: Strengthening vice-admiralty courts to crack down on smuggling and ensure compliance with trade regulations.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>What ideas of "self government"? Where did these come from?</h4>
            <p>The ideas of self-government came from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Local Traditions: For over 100 years, many colonies had been governing their internal affairs through their own elected assemblies (like the Virginia House of Burgesses) which controlled budgets and passed local laws.</li>
                <li>British Precedent: The tradition of English liberties, such as the right to a trial by jury and the principle that one's property could not be taken without consent (through representation in Parliament).</li>
                <li>Enlightenment Ideas: The writings of John Locke and others, which argued that governments derive their power from the consent of the governed.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>What taxes?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The Sugar Act (1764): A tax on imported sugar and molasses.</li>
                <li>The Stamp Act (1765): A direct tax on all printed materials (newspapers, legal documents, playing cards).</li>
                <li>The Townshend Acts (1767): Taxes on imported goods like glass, lead, paint, paper, and tea.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>What is meant by "colonial representation"?</h4>
            <p>The colonists believed in "actual representation," meaning they were only obligated to pay taxes passed by their own elected representatives in their colonial assemblies. The British government argued for "virtual representation," the idea that all members of Parliament represented the interests of all British subjects, including the colonists, even though the colonists could not vote for them. The colonists rejected this concept.</p>
            
            <h4>Why might colonists feel "constraints on economic activities"?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Taxes: New taxes like the Sugar Act and Townshend Acts increased the cost of doing business.</li>
                <li>Suppression of Smuggling: British efforts to enforce trade laws and stop smuggling threatened the lucrative, if illegal, trade that many colonial merchants relied on.</li>
                <li>Monopolies: Acts like the Tea Act (1773) granted a monopoly to the British East India Company, undercutting colonial merchants.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Why might colonists feel "constraints on political rights"?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Dissolving Assemblies: British governors dissolved colonial assemblies (like in Massachusetts after the Circular Letter) for protesting British policies, stripping colonists of their political voice.</li>
                <li>Trial Without Jury: The expansion of vice-admiralty courts meant colonists could be tried for smuggling without a jury of their peers.</li>
                <li>The Massachusetts Government Act: Part of the Intolerable Acts, it revoked Massachusetts' charter and took away its long-held right to self-government.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>...it limited their ability to take land from the Indians, and it also left them holding the bag for a lot of war debt.</li>
                <li>Earlier taxes (like the Molasses Act) were primarily about regulating trade within the mercantile system and were easily avoided via smuggling. Post-war taxes (like the Stamp Act) were explicitly designed to raise revenue from the colonies and were enforced much more strictly.</li>
                <li>They organized the Stamp Act Congress, formed the Sons of Liberty, initiated boycotts of British goods, and used crowd action/violence (tarring and feathering) against tax collectors.</li>
                <li>Boycotts were collective refusals to buy British goods. They were effective because they hurt British merchants economically, who then pressured Parliament to repeal the taxes.</li>

                <li>It was the first truly unified colonial government, coordinating resistance across colony lines (e.g., the Continental Association to enforce boycotts). It marked a shift from protesting as separate colonies to acting as a united body.</li>
                <li>The American Revolution refers to the broader ideological, political, and social movement towards independence. The American War for Independence is the specific military conflict (1775-1783) that was part of that revolution.</li>
                <li>Elites in colonies like New York and Pennsylvania were nervous about the revolutionary fervor empowering common people (artisans, small farmers) and disrupting the social and economic order. They preferred reconciliation to protect their status.</li>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>What 3 things does the Massachusetts Circular Letter say?</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It denounces the Townshend Revenue Acts.</li>
                        <li>It attacks the British plan to make royal officials independent of colonial assemblies.</li>
                        <li>It urges the colonies to find a way to "harmonize with each other" and take common action.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Who was the wealthiest merchant in the colonies?</strong>
                    <p>John Hancock.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Based on its usage on page 115, what do you think the word sloop means?</strong>
                    <p>Based on the context of it being seized by customs officers and belonging to a merchant, a sloop is a type of sailing ship used for trade.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>(116) Read about Paul Revere's picture. What is it considered?</strong>
                    <p>The image("The Bostonians Paying the Excise-Man, or Tarring and Feathering") became an enduring American favorite and a celebration of the righteous violence of the Revolution.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>(117) Briefly describe the purpose of Committees of Correspondence?</strong>
                    <p>Their purpose was to serve as the principal channel for sharing information, shaping public opinion, and building cooperation among the colonies.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>(118) What is the image all about? In your opinion, how does this make the colonists look?</strong>
                    <p><strong>What it's about:</strong> The image depicts a Boston mob tarring and feathering a British customs official, John Malcolm, as punishment for his actions. The Boston Tea Party is shown in the background.</p>
                    <p><strong>How it makes the colonists look:</strong> (Opinion) It makes the colonists look violent, intimidating, and ruthless. While the text mentions it was embraced by Patriots, the details (hot tar, feathers, noose) portray a mob using brutal public humiliation and the threat of death to enforce their will.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>(120) Why did the British go to Lexington and Concord? What happened there?</strong>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> General Gage sent troops to Concord to seize the colonial armory and stores of weapons and gunpowder.</p>
                    <p><strong>What happened:</strong> At Lexington, the British encountered a group of minutemen. Shots were fired, killing eight Americans. The British moved on to Concord, burned some supplies, and were then attacked by a growing militia force on their retreat back to Boston, suffering heavy casualties (73 killed, 202 wounded).</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>(126) Communities in Conflict. What are 3 separate points Boucher and Paine make?</strong>

                                <td>3. The relationship with Britain is broken beyond repair, comparing it to a rape that cannot be forgiven. America must become an "asylum for mankind."</td>
